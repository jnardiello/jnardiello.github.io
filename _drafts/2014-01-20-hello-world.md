After a quite long time i *finally* found some time to launch my personal website. I tried multiple times in the past, using different platforms (wordpress, medium, ghost) but was never happy. I've spent by far too many hours trying to build a virtual place i'd be happy to call "home", with a look aligned with my personal philosophy and contents from my personal and professional life.  

For every time i tried, every time i ended up being just frustrated and deeply unhappy with the result. While reaching a nice appearance has been always the easier part, knowing that the content was published with platforms that were (at best) "*black bagic*" has been always extremely frustrating. I wanted something *simple*, where i owned the content, on which i could hack easily without an unreasonable amount of time spent studying random documentation and (last but not least) where content was king.

So far, everything i tried either required lot of time spent for configuration, unreasonable costs or my content was owned by third parties (or a mix of these).

Finally i reached some equilibrium. Switched to Jekyll, crafted the theme (that i called tenzo), hosted on github.

Here i'll be writing mostly about coding and computer science, occasionally about math and life. It will be an interesting adventure writing here and i hope that you will enjoy the ride with me. You can follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/jnardiello) or add to your favurites the rss feed.

PS: English isn't my first language, it is very very likely that i'll make mistakes. Please, if you spot any, open an issue on [github](https://github.com/jnardiello/jnardiello.github.io).
