![Hello Spreaker](https://scontent-mxp1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/t31.0-8/11078257_10152831403801347_8094100540044052540_o.jpg)

The big news is that starting next week I'll be joining [Spreaker](http://spreaker.com) as a backend and architecture engineer. If you don't know them already, they are one of the big players in the podcasting world. Their platform (Web app and [Spreaker Studio](https://www.spreaker.com/download)) allows to record, distribute, measure and listen podcasts. Their community currently hosts thousands of shows.

While I have no idea what it's going to be like working with them, I know for sure that their tech team has some of the best engineers I know and the company culture they managed to grow is just amazing (more on this in future posts).

On my side it's going to be a fairly big shift and a completely new challenge. I will spend a lot of my time automating their infrastructure, which means less pure software engineering and more devops.  

> The only thing I'm sure is that I'll learn hell of a lot and that's all I could ask.

Next week I'll be in Rimini to work with [Marco](http://twitter.com/pracucci). I'll keep you all posted and wish me luck!
