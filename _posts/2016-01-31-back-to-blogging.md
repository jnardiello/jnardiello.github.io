Despite my best intentions, this blog went dead for a little over two years. 

Now I really feel it's time to change, it's critical to start writing again. My main goal is to start shaping organizations and the technical community around me, publishing articles is the first small step toward this direction.

I will try to keep all my articles relevant and focused on software engineering and automation. I might throw a few articles about finance too as I'm increasingly getting into it.

This blog doesn't provide (on purpose) a comments section. That's because I love interactions and conversations therefore you are highly encouraged to ping me directly [here](http://twitter.com/jnardiello).
